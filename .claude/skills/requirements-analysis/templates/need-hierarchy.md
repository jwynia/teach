# Need Hierarchy: [Project Name]

## Core Needs (Must Have)

These are essential. Without them, the problem isn't solved.

### Need 1: [Need description - start with verb]

**Why essential:** [What fails if this is missing]
**Derived from:** [Which part of the problem statement]
**Testable by:** [How you'd verify this need is satisfied]
**Minimum viable:** [Smallest implementation that satisfies]

### Need 2: [Need description]

**Why essential:**
**Derived from:**
**Testable by:**
**Minimum viable:**

### Need 3: [Need description]

**Why essential:**
**Derived from:**
**Testable by:**
**Minimum viable:**

## Supporting Needs (Should Have)

These significantly improve the solution but aren't essential for V1.

### Need: [Need description]

**Why valuable:** [What it adds]
**Depends on:** [Which core need must exist first]
**Defer trigger:** [What would make this become Must Have]

### Need: [Need description]

**Why valuable:**
**Depends on:**
**Defer trigger:**

## Enhancement Needs (Could Have)

Nice to have if time permits. Won't delay V1.

### Need: [Need description]

**Value if included:** [What it adds]
**Why deferrable:** [Why this can wait]

---

## Explicitly Deferred (Won't Have in V1)

Acknowledged as potentially valuable but consciously excluded.

### Need: [Need description]

**Why deferred:** [Reason for exclusion]
**Reconsider when:** [Trigger for bringing this back]

### Need: [Need description]

**Why deferred:**
**Reconsider when:**

## Validation

Before proceeding, confirm:
- [ ] Each need starts with a verb (action, not thing)
- [ ] No need contains implementation/technology words
- [ ] Core needs are genuinely essential (would you ship without them?)
- [ ] Each need traces back to problem statement
- [ ] Each need has testable acceptance criteria
- [ ] At least one thing is in "Won't Have"
