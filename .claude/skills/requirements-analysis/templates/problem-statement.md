# Problem Statement: [Project Name]

## The Problem

[One paragraph: Who has what problem, and what happens because of it. No solutions, only problems.]

**Who:** [Specific person or role - "I" is valid for solo projects]
**Problem:** [What's wrong, frustrating, or missing]
**Impact:** [What happens because of this problem]

## Current State

[How is this being handled today? What's the workaround, even if it's "suffer through it"?]

**Current approach:**
**Why it's insufficient:**

## Why Now

[What triggered this? What's changed that makes this worth solving now?]

## Success Looks Like

[How would you know the problem is solved? Be specific enough to test.]

- [ ] [Concrete success indicator 1]
- [ ] [Concrete success indicator 2]
- [ ] [Concrete success indicator 3]

## Not Trying to Solve

[Explicitly out of scope - problems that might seem related but aren't being addressed]

- [Related problem we're NOT solving]
- [Adjacent problem we're NOT solving]

## Validation

Before proceeding, confirm:
- [ ] Problem statement contains no solution words (no technology, no features)
- [ ] "Who" is specific (not "users" or "everyone")
- [ ] Impact is real and felt (not theoretical)
- [ ] Success criteria are testable
- [ ] At least one thing is explicitly out of scope
