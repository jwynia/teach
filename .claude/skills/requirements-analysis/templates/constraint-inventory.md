# Constraint Inventory: [Project Name]

## Real Constraints (Facts)

These are definitely true. Not negotiable.

| Constraint | Impact on Solution | Source/Evidence |
|------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| [constraint] | [how it limits options] | [why you know it's true] |
| [constraint] | [impact] | [source] |
| [constraint] | [impact] | [source] |

### Time Constraints
- **Available hours per week:** [number]
- **Target completion:** [date or "no deadline"]
- **Hard deadline (if any):** [date and why]

### Skill Constraints
- **Skills I have:** [list]
- **Skills I'd need to learn:** [list]
- **Skills explicitly avoiding:** [list - things I won't learn for this]

### Resource Constraints
- **Budget:** [amount or "zero"]
- **Infrastructure available:** [what exists]
- **Tools/services committed to:** [if any]

### Integration Constraints
- **Must work with:** [existing systems, APIs, data sources]
- **Must NOT touch:** [off-limits systems]

## Assumptions (To Validate)

Things I believe are true but haven't confirmed.

| Assumption | If Wrong... | How to Validate | Status |
|------------|-------------|-----------------|--------|
| [assumption] | [consequence if false] | [validation approach] | Unvalidated / Validated / Invalidated |
| [assumption] | [consequence] | [approach] | |
| [assumption] | [consequence] | [approach] | |

## Risks (Pre-Mortem Results)

"It's 6 months later and this project failed. What happened?"

| Failure Mode | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|--------------|-------------|--------|------------|
| [how it could fail] | H/M/L | H/M/L | [what reduces risk] |
| [failure mode] | | | |
| [failure mode] | | | |

### Top 3 Risks to Monitor
1. [Risk] - Watch for: [early warning sign]
2. [Risk] - Watch for: [early warning sign]
3. [Risk] - Watch for: [early warning sign]

## Dependencies

Things that must exist or happen before/during this project.

| Dependency | Type | Status | Blocker If Missing |
|------------|------|--------|-------------------|
| [dependency] | External / Internal / Learning | Available / Pending / Unknown | Yes / No |
| [dependency] | | | |

## Validation

Before proceeding, confirm:
- [ ] Time constraint is realistic (not aspirational)
- [ ] At least 3 assumptions are identified
- [ ] Pre-mortem identified non-obvious failure modes
- [ ] Dependencies are listed with current status
- [ ] Nothing is listed as "constraint" that's actually a preference
