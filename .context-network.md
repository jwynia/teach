# Project Context Network

## Location

The context network for this project is located at: `./context/`

## Purpose

This context network maintains persistent knowledge about Teach:
- Project state and active research
- Architecture and design decisions
- Domain vocabulary and conventions
- Open questions and hypotheses

## Audience

- **Agents**: AI assistants working on this project
- **Maintainers**: Developers contributing to the codebase
- **Future self**: Context preservation across sessions

## What Belongs Here vs. Project Root

| Context Network (`context/`) | Project Root |
|------------------------------|--------------|
| Planning documents | Source code |
| Architecture decisions | Configuration files |
| Design discussions | User-facing documentation |
| Research questions | Build artifacts |
| Internal documentation | Tests |

**Rule**: If it's about "how we'll build it" → Context Network. If it's "the thing we're building" → Project Root.

## Navigation

Start here:
- **Current state**: `context/status.md`
- **Key decisions**: `context/decisions.md`
- **Vocabulary**: `context/glossary.md`
- **Open questions**: `context/questions.md`

## Agent Instructions
