# Basic Prompting: Simple Patterns for Better AI Results

You can dramatically improve AI output with a few simple techniques. No special skills required—just being clearer about what you actually want.

## The Core Problem

When you're vague, the AI fills in the gaps with guesses. Those guesses are usually the most common patterns from its training data—which means generic, average output.

**Vague request:**
> "Write an email to my team."

**What the AI doesn't know:**
- What's the email about?
- What tone should it have?
- What do you want the team to do?
- How long should it be?

The AI will guess, and it will guess "average."

**More specific request:**
> "Write a brief email to my team announcing that our project deadline moved from Friday to next Wednesday. Keep it under 100 words. Friendly but direct tone."

Now the AI knows what to produce. You'll get something much closer to what you need.

## Pattern 1: Be Specific About What You Want

The more context and constraints you provide, the better the output.

### Instead of This → Try This

| Vague | Specific |
|-------|----------|
| "Write a thank you note" | "Write a thank you note to a client who referred us business. Professional but warm. 2-3 sentences." |
| "Summarize this document" | "Summarize this document in 5 bullet points, focusing on the action items." |
| "Help me with my presentation" | "Help me write 3 talking points about why remote work improves productivity. Each point should be 1-2 sentences." |
| "Make this better" | "Make this email more concise—cut it to half the length while keeping the main ask clear." |

### What to Specify

- **Purpose**: What is this for? Who will read/use it?
- **Tone**: Formal? Casual? Friendly? Professional?
- **Length**: How long should it be? (Word count, number of points, etc.)
- **Format**: Email? Bullet points? Paragraph? Table?
- **Key elements**: What must be included?

## Pattern 2: Provide Context

The AI only knows what you tell it. If you want it to consider specific information, include it.

**Without context:**
> "Write a performance review for Sarah."

The AI knows nothing about Sarah and will produce something completely generic.

**With context:**
> "Write a performance review for Sarah, a customer service representative who:
> - Handled 20% more calls than average this quarter
> - Received excellent customer feedback scores
> - Needs improvement in documentation habits
> Focus on strengths with constructive feedback on documentation."

Now the AI can write something relevant and specific.

### Context Worth Including

- Background information the AI needs
- Examples of what you're looking for
- What has/hasn't worked before
- Constraints or requirements
- Your role or perspective

## Pattern 3: Ask for the Format You Need

If you need a specific format, say so. The AI can produce almost any format if you specify it.

**Format options to ask for:**
- "Give me this as a bulleted list"
- "Format this as a table with columns for [X] and [Y]"
- "Write this as an email with a clear subject line"
- "Break this into numbered steps"
- "Keep each point to one sentence"

**Example:**
> "List the pros and cons of working from home. Format as a table with two columns."

The AI will produce a nicely formatted table instead of paragraphs.

## Pattern 4: Use Examples

If you have a specific style or format in mind, show the AI an example.

**With example:**
> "Write product descriptions for our new items in this style:
>
> Example: 'The Sunrise Mug — Wake up to hand-thrown ceramic that keeps your coffee warm and your mornings bright. Dishwasher safe. 12oz.'
>
> New products to describe:
> - Travel thermos (16oz, stainless steel)
> - Espresso cup set (4 cups, glazed stoneware)"

The AI will match the style, length, and format of your example.

## Pattern 5: Ask One Thing at a Time

Complex requests with multiple parts often get uneven attention. The AI might nail the first part and rush through the rest.

**Overloaded request:**
> "Research our competitors, analyze their pricing, write a comparison document, and recommend what we should charge."

**Better approach:**
Ask each part separately:
1. "List our main competitors in [market]."
2. "Here are the competitors. What are their pricing models?"
3. "Based on this pricing info, what are the key differences?"
4. "Given these differences, what pricing approach would you recommend for us?"

Each step gets full attention.

## Pattern 6: Tell It What to Avoid

Sometimes it's helpful to specify what you *don't* want.

**Examples:**
- "Write this without using jargon—it's for non-technical readers"
- "Don't include generic advice like 'be confident'—I need specific techniques"
- "Skip the introduction and get straight to the recommendations"
- "Avoid words like 'innovative' and 'cutting-edge'—they're overused"

## Pattern 7: Draft → Refine

Instead of trying to get perfect output in one request, use a two-step process:

1. **Get a first draft**: Ask for what you need
2. **Refine it**: Tell the AI what to change

**Step 1:**
> "Write a brief bio for my LinkedIn profile. I'm a marketing manager with 10 years experience in B2B tech."

**Step 2 (after seeing the draft):**
> "Good start, but make it less formal—more conversational. Also mention that I specialize in content marketing."

This is often faster and more effective than trying to specify everything upfront.

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake: Being Too Vague
❌ "Help me write something"
✅ "Help me write a 200-word introduction for a blog post about remote work trends"

### Mistake: Expecting Mind-Reading
❌ "Make this better"
✅ "Make this clearer and cut it to half the length"

### Mistake: One Giant Request
❌ "Plan my entire marketing strategy for next year"
✅ Break it into specific pieces: goals, channels, campaigns, timeline, budget

### Mistake: Not Iterating
❌ Accepting the first response even when it's not quite right
✅ Give feedback and ask for revisions: "This is too long. Cut it in half."

## Quick Reference Card

When writing a prompt, consider including:

| Element | Example |
|---------|---------|
| **Task** | "Write a meeting summary..." |
| **Context** | "...for a project kickoff meeting where we discussed..." |
| **Audience** | "...to send to the team members who couldn't attend." |
| **Format** | "Use bullet points." |
| **Length** | "Keep it under 200 words." |
| **Tone** | "Professional but friendly." |
| **Constraints** | "Don't include the budget discussion—that's confidential." |

You don't need all of these every time, but the more you include, the better the output.

## Try This

Take something you recently asked an AI tool to do where the result was just "okay."

1. Look at what you asked for
2. Identify what was vague or assumed
3. Rewrite the request with more specifics
4. Compare the new output to the original

Notice how being specific gives the AI something to aim for instead of guessing.
