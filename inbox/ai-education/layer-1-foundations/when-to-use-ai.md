# When to Use AI (And When Not To)

AI tools are genuinely useful—for certain things. They're also genuinely risky or wasteful for other things. Knowing the difference helps you get value without creating problems.

## The "Confident Intern" Test

Here's a mental model: **Would you trust a confident intern with this task?**

An AI is like an intern who:
- Has read an enormous amount but experienced little
- Works fast and never gets tired
- Sounds confident even when wrong
- Won't push back on bad ideas
- Has no stake in the outcome

**If your answer is "yes, but I'd check their work"**—the AI is probably a good fit.

**If your answer is "no, I need someone experienced"**—be cautious.

## AI Is Good At

### 1. First Drafts and Starting Points

AI excels at getting something on the page that you can then react to and refine.

**Good uses:**
- Draft an email you'll edit before sending
- Outline a document you'll then write
- Generate options for a project name to consider
- Create a rough agenda for a meeting

**Why it works:** Having something to react to is easier than starting from blank. The AI gives you raw material.

### 2. Brainstorming and Idea Generation

AI can quickly generate lists of options, approaches, or ideas to consider.

**Good uses:**
- "Give me 10 possible angles for this presentation"
- "What are some ways companies solve this problem?"
- "What questions should I ask in this customer interview?"

**Why it works:** Quantity of ideas is easy for AI, and you can filter for quality. You're using the AI for divergent thinking, then applying your judgment.

### 3. Reformatting and Transforming

AI is excellent at converting content from one format to another.

**Good uses:**
- Turn meeting notes into action items
- Convert a report into bullet points
- Rewrite technical content for a non-technical audience
- Create a table from a list

**Why it works:** The information already exists—you're just changing how it's organized or expressed.

### 4. Summarizing and Condensing

AI can compress long content into shorter versions effectively.

**Good uses:**
- Summarize a long email thread
- Extract key points from a document
- Create an executive summary
- Condense meeting notes

**Why it works:** The AI can process the content quickly and identify main points. You can verify the summary hits the key items.

### 5. Explaining and Simplifying

AI can take complex topics and explain them in simpler terms.

**Good uses:**
- "Explain this technical concept in plain language"
- "What does this contract clause mean in everyday terms?"
- "Break down this process step by step"

**Why it works:** The AI has seen many explanations of many topics and can adapt the complexity level.

### 6. Tedious Text Tasks

Any repetitive text task where you'd be tempted to cut corners.

**Good uses:**
- Write variations of the same message for different audiences
- Generate placeholder content
- Create consistent formatting across documents
- Draft routine correspondence

**Why it works:** AI doesn't get bored or tired. It applies the same effort to the 20th variation as the first.

## AI Is Risky For

### 1. Facts That Matter

AI confidently makes things up. If accuracy matters, verify.

**Risky uses:**
- Research citations (it invents them)
- Specific statistics or numbers
- Historical dates and details
- Legal or medical information
- Anything you'll be held accountable for

**What to do instead:** Use AI to draft, but verify facts from reliable sources. Never use AI as your only source for factual claims that matter.

### 2. Final Decisions

AI has no stake in the outcome. It can't weigh what matters to you.

**Risky uses:**
- Deciding whether to take a job offer
- Choosing between strategic options
- Evaluating people (hiring, reviews)
- Any decision with significant consequences

**What to do instead:** Use AI to explore options or organize your thinking, but make the decision yourself.

### 3. Sensitive or Confidential Information

What you type into most AI tools could be seen by others or used for training.

**Risky uses:**
- Confidential business data
- Personal information about identifiable people
- Client or customer data
- Anything covered by privacy regulations or NDAs

**What to do instead:** See [Data and Privacy Basics](data-privacy-basics.md) for how to evaluate what's safe.

### 4. Current Events and Recent Information

Most AI tools were trained on data up to a certain date and don't know what happened after.

**Risky uses:**
- "What happened in last week's news?"
- "What's the current stock price?"
- Recent policy changes, new laws, or current events

**What to do instead:** Use current sources for current information. Some AI tools have web search—but verify what they find.

### 5. Nuanced Human Situations

AI doesn't understand social dynamics, organizational politics, or emotional complexity.

**Risky uses:**
- Navigating a conflict with a colleague
- Handling a sensitive performance conversation
- Understanding why a client is really upset
- Any situation requiring empathy and judgment

**What to do instead:** Use AI for general frameworks or scripts, but apply your own understanding of the actual people and situation.

### 6. Anything Where Being Wrong Has Serious Consequences

If a mistake would cause real harm—financial, legal, reputational, physical—don't rely on AI.

**Risky uses:**
- Medical or health advice
- Legal documents or advice
- Financial decisions with significant money at stake
- Safety-related information

**What to do instead:** Get professional advice from qualified humans. AI can help you prepare questions or understand basics, but isn't a substitute for expertise.

## The Judgment Calls

Some tasks are "it depends." Here's how to think about them:

### Writing for External Audiences

**Lower risk:** First draft, then significant editing by you
**Higher risk:** Published with minimal review

Your editing is what ensures quality and catches errors. Less editing = more risk.

### Research and Analysis

**Lower risk:** Exploring a topic, generating hypotheses, organizing what you find
**Higher risk:** Treating AI output as your research findings

Use AI to accelerate your thinking, not replace it.

### Communication on Your Behalf

**Lower risk:** Draft that you read carefully and edit
**Higher risk:** Automated sending without human review

Anything that goes out with your name on it deserves your eyes on it.

## Quick Reference: What's It Good For?

| Task Type | AI Good For | Verify/Edit |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| **First drafts** | Yes | Edit before using |
| **Brainstorming** | Yes | Filter with judgment |
| **Reformatting** | Yes | Quick check |
| **Summarizing** | Yes | Verify key points captured |
| **Explaining** | Yes | Check for accuracy |
| **Facts/citations** | No (makes them up) | Always verify |
| **Decisions** | No (no stake) | Inform, don't delegate |
| **Sensitive data** | No (privacy risk) | Use approved tools only |
| **Current events** | No (outdated) | Use current sources |
| **High-stakes content** | Cautious | Heavy editing required |

## Try This

Next time you consider using AI for a task, ask:

1. **Confident intern test:** Would I trust an intern to do this if I checked their work?
2. **Stakes check:** What happens if this is wrong or mediocre?
3. **Verification burden:** How much work will it take to verify?

If the answers are "yes," "not much," and "quick check"—go for it.

If the answers are "no," "serious consequences," and "a lot"—either don't use AI or plan for significant verification and editing.
